# MongoDB Connection String Needed

I have your credentials:
- Username: `shraga013_db_user`
- Password: `amLSQ36xjkk98iN3`

## What I Need

The full MongoDB connection string from your Atlas dashboard. It should look like:

```
mongodb+srv://shraga013_db_user:amLSQ36xjkk98iN3@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## How to Get It

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Click "Connect" on your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Select "Node.js" driver
5. Copy the connection string
6. Provide it to me

## Alternative

If you can just tell me your **cluster hostname** (the part like `cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net`), I can build the connection string for you.
