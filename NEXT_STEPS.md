# Next Steps - Open New PowerShell

## ⚠️ Important: Open a NEW PowerShell Window

Google Cloud CLI is installed, but your current PowerShell session doesn't have it in the PATH yet.

## Steps:

### 1. Open NEW PowerShell
- Press `Windows Key`
- Type "PowerShell"
- Click "Windows PowerShell"

### 2. Verify gcloud is working
```powershell
gcloud --version
```

You should see:
```
Google Cloud SDK 4xx.x.x
...
```

### 3. Navigate to your project
```powershell
cd C:\Users\OSUser\.gemini\antigravity\playground\obsidian-equinox\daily-appreciation-app\server
```

### 4. Ready to Deploy!

Once you're in the `server` folder with gcloud working, let me know and I'll give you the deployment commands!

1. **Backend to Google Cloud Run** (~10 minutes)
2. **Frontend to Firebase Hosting** (~5 minutes)

You're almost there! 🚀
